# AC130Flight
This project focuses on building an arcade style flight simulator of an AC-130J. It is controlled primarily through rigid body physics so the 3 DOF of pitch, roll, and yaw are present in the game mechanics making it straightforward an easy to handle. 

If the plane's position changes: pitch up/down or roll left/right, serial communication will be established to an arduino which will control 3 servo motors to mirror the AC-130J's position in the simulation representing 3 DOFs. 

**Made in Unity 2019.2**
